# High Issues

## H-1: Arbitrary `from` passed to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`)

Passing an arbitrary `from` address to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`) can lead to loss of funds, because anyone can transfer tokens from the `from` address if an approval is made.

	```solidity
	        token.transferFrom(from, address(vault), amount);
	```

</details>



## H-2: Functions send eth away from contract but performs no checks on any address.

Consider introducing checks for `msg.sender` to ensure the recipient of the money is as intended.

	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

</details>



## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

## L-3: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

	```solidity
	        token = _token;
	```

</details>



## L-4: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/TokenFactory.sol [Line: 23](src/TokenFactory.sol#L23)

	```solidity
	    function deployToken(string memory symbol, bytes memory contractBytecode) public onlyOwner returns (address addr) {
	```

	```solidity
	    function getTokenAddressFromSymbol(string memory symbol) public view returns (address addr) {
	```

</details>



## L-5: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event TokenDeployed(string symbol, address addr);
	```

</details>



## L-6: The `nonReentrant` `modifier` should occur before all other modifiers

This is a best-practice to protect against reentrancy in other modifiers.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/L1BossBridge.sol [Line: 81](src/L1BossBridge.sol#L81)

	```solidity
	    function sendToL1(uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s, bytes memory message) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
	```

</details>



## L-7: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

## L-8: Large literal values multiples of 10000 can be replaced with scientific notation

Use `e` notation, for example: `1e18`, instead of its full numeric value.

	    uint256 private constant INITIAL_SUPPLY = 1_000_000;
	```

</details>



## L-9: State variable could be declared constant

State variables that are not updated following deployment should be declared constant to save gas. Add the `constant` attribute to state variables that never change.

- Found in src/L1BossBridge.sol [Line: 27](src/L1BossBridge.sol#L27)

	```solidity

## L-10: State variable changes but no event is emitted.

State variable changes in this function but no event is emitted.

	```solidity
	    function setSigner(address account, bool enabled) external onlyOwner {
	```

</details>



## L-11: State variable could be declared immutable

State variables that are should be declared immutable to save gas. Add the `immutable` attribute to state variables that are only changed in the constructor
